# JS-Mastery

Brushing up JS and React step-by-step

## Day 1 - Variables & Data Types

- Learned about let, const, var
- Practiced with numbers, strings, booleans
- Used typeof to check data types
- Wrote examples in daily-practice/day01.js

## Day 2 - Operators & Conditionals

- Learned arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`
- Practiced assignment operators like `+=`
- Understood comparison operators: `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Learned logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- Used `if`, `else if`, `else` for branching
- Practiced ternary operator for concise conditions

## Day 3 - Loops

- Learned `for`, `while`, `do...while` loops
- Practiced using `break` and `continue` to control loops

## Day 4 - Functions

- Learned function declaration, expression, and arrow functions
- Practiced with parameters, default values, and return
- Understood difference between console.log vs return
- Explored scope of variables inside functions

## Day 5 - Arrays & Objects

- Created arrays, accessed/updated elements
- Used methods: push, pop, shift, unshift
- Looping arrays (for, for...of, forEach)
- Objects: key-value pairs, nested objects, array of objects

## Day 6 - Higher Order Array Methods

- Learned about `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
- Practiced array transformations, filtering, and aggregations

## Day 7 - Reduce() Deep Dive

- Deep dive into reduce()

## Day 8 - Modern JavaScript (ES6+) Features

- Deep dived into `Destructuring Assignment` for arrays and objects.
- Explored the dual roles of the three dots: `Spread (...)` for expanding/merging and `Rest (...)` for collecting arguments/properties.
- Mastered `Template Literals` (backticks) for clean string interpolation and multi-line strings.

## Day 9 - Asynchronous JavaScript (Part 1: Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await)

- Understood the concept of the **Single-Threaded** nature of JS and the role of the **Event Loop**.
- Explored **Callbacks** as the traditional async solution and recognized the problem of **Callback Hell**.
- Mastered **Promises**, including their three states (**Pending, Fulfilled, Rejected**), and chaining with `.then()` and `.catch()`.
- Implemented the modern **`async/await`** syntax, learning how it uses a **`try...catch`** block to handle promise rejection cleanly.

## Day 10 - JS Modules & Sets/Maps

- Modularization: Mastered **`import`** and **`export`** (named and default) for structuring large applications.
- Advanced Arrays: Learned about `flat()` and `flatMap()` for handling nested data.
- Built-in Data Structures: Explored and practiced using **Sets** (for unique values) and **Maps** (for efficient key-value lookups), emphasizing their $O(1)$ efficiency.
- Solved a data cleaning problem using `Set` to find unique elements.
